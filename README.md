# project0
This is my submission for Project 0 for Harvard's CS50 "Web Programming with Python and JavaScript". This website works as a mini Wikipedia about the Harry Potter books and movies. It contains some information about the main characters, creatures and spells of the history.  To create the website, I used HTML 5 and CSS features including Bootstrap 4, SASS, media queries, tables, lists and images. The structure of the website consists in 4 HTML pages and 2 stylesheets, being one of CSS and one of SASS. 
All html pages are responsive and all of them have a responsive navegation bar to allow the user to navigate throughout the website. 

index.html: This page is the Home Page of the website. Its structure is mainly made with Bootstrap Columns. It contains an introductory text to the website, followed by anunordered list, an ordered list and a table. 

creatures.html: This is the creatures page of the website. Its main structure is a flex box. The cards structure and design were chosen in the Bootstrap website. 

spells.html: This is the spells page of the website. Its main structure is a flex box. 

characters.html: This is the characters page of the website. Its main structure is a flex box. The cards structure and design were chosen in the Bootstrap website.
